# Containers

- STL Containers are divided into 3 categories
    - Sequence Containers
    - Associative Containers
    - Container Adapters

## Sequence Conatiners
- store elements in linear arrangements, preserving
order in which elements are inserted.
- eg., vector, deque, list


## Associative Containers
- store elements in a way that enables fast retrieval based on keys. 
- They use binary tree or hash-based structure to keep elements sorted and quickly searchable
- eg., set, map, multiset, multimap

## Container Adaptors
- provide a restricted interface to the underlying container. 
- They adapt existing containers like deque, vector to provide specialized behaviour such as stack or queue operations.
- eg., stack, queue, prority_queue
