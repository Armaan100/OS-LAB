# STL

- Enables the use of 
    - containers    ->  classes that store collection of elements. eg., vector
    - algorithms    ->  functions that perform operations on data. eg., sort()
    - iterators     ->  objects that enable traversal of elements in containers.
    to work with data structures in a generic manner


- Key features
    - Generic Programming
    - Efficiency
    - Type Safety
    - Reusability
