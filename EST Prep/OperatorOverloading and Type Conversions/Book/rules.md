# Rules for overloading operators
- only existing operators can be overloaded. New operators cannot be overloaded
- The overloaded operator must have atleast one operand that is of user-defined type
- We cannot change the basic meaning of an operator i.e., we cannot redefine the plus(+) operator to subtract one value from the other
- Overloaded operators follow the syntax rules of the original opeators. They cannot be overridden.
- There are some operators which cannot be overloaded/
    - Class member access operators(., .*)
    - Scope resolution operator (::)
    - Size operator(sizeof)
    - Conditional operator(?:)
- We cannot use friend functions to overload certain operators. However member functions can be used to overload them
    - Assignment Operator(=)
    - Function Call Operator ()
    - Substring Operator []
    - Class member access operator (->)
- When using binary operators overloaded through a member function, the left hand operand must be an object of the relevant class
- Binary aritmetic operatos such as *, -, / and + must explicitly return a value. They must not attempt to change their own arguments.
